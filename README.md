# Blogger - the simplest web app with both front and back end! ðŸ¥³

My first (real) backend supported app. Yay!

Allows blog posting, editing and deleting! *The most basic blogging app* basically.

## Features

- Post a Blog! Each blog even has a unique ID and a post date!
- Edit a posted blog!
- Delete that stupid post!

...that's it.

## Maybe features in the future

- Local storage of blogs
- *ONLINE* storage of blogs AKA integration of Databases
- Higher formatting in the blogs
- Login! Author system!
- A community? Who knows atp.

Imma add any new cool additions i think of.

But Yay! Backend isn't as foggy as it was before! Here is to progress ðŸ¥‚
